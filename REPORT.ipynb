    "This codebase implements a **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** agent based upon the groundbreaking work by Google DeepMind, found here:  \n",
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, and as the default behavior (and all of the below graphed results), **Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN)** is implemented. DDQN provides more stable and faster learning than the original algorithm.  \n",
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic algorithm uses a Neural Network to approximate the Action-Value function (Q) and generate an optimal policy by maximizing the returns. DeepMind's breakthrough was to use Experience Replay, by storing previous experiences for future learning, and off-policy networks to stabilize learning, which had previously been unstable when learning on-policy with neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**DQN** learns by minimizing the error as computed by the value predictions between an online learning policy, and a delayed copy called a Target Network, which is updated only irregularly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**DDQN**'s continuation of this concept is to stabilize action-value estimation by estimating the value of the target network using the maximizing action under the active/local network. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Lastly, this agent uses N-Step Bootstrapping as adapted from later project agents. N-Step bootstrapping performs Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning across N steps instead of a single SARS' tuple. N-Step bootstrapping is not required, nor especially beneficial to this environment and will be left to other projects for a more full description.*\n"

    "### Hyper Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**DDQN** has proven robust to a fairly wide variety of hyperparameters. \n",
    "* **`LEARN_RATE`** The above graphs show an order of magnitude variance in Learning Rate while still converging to optimal performance.\n",
    "* **`C/TAU`** I have consistently, across all projects, found that a HARD update type utilizing a parameter C controlling how many timesteps between updates, gives me superior performance over soft-update style gradual target network updating using parameter TAU. In the above graphs, C is consistently set to 650, though 720 is used in  the third. The relationship between training and updates seems to remain somewhat ambiguous, however, for this project, ensuring that some small multiple of episodes passes before updating the network provided good results. As this Banana environment performed 300 timesteps before reaching a Done state, 650-750 was a good range of allowing for learning before updating the networks.\n",
    "* **`EPSILON`** Annealing Epsilon at a slow rate was key to stable and fast learning as well, allowing a balance between exploration and exploitation. In this project, Epsilon annealing is has no relationship with actual Agent performance, and in later code this is no longer the case. Epsilon annealing rate should have some relationship with Agent performance for the most consistent results without requiring hand tuning. However, this requires some knowledge of the environment about *what constitutes a good score or good performance.*\n",
    "* **`PRETRAIN`** Interestingly, it was found that filling the ReplayBuffer with many more memories than required to sample a batch led to significantly worse performance or non-convergence. This is counterinuitive and in fact the opposite of findings from other projects, and should be further studied. Regardless, for Banana, pretrain was best left at a low number.\n",
    "* **`ROLLOUT`** As stated above, n-step rollout was allowed to run in this environment, but was inconsequential to the results. This parameter could be set to 1 and achieve the same scores. Theoretically, having a rollout contribution should stabilize learning, but there was not computing bandwidth to run trials of this.\n",
    "* **`L2_DECAY`** Adding a very small Adam Optimizer l2 decay seemed to be a benefit, this parameter was never tuned in a meaningful way."

    "### Future Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "* This was my first Reinforcement Learning project and as such some of the code is not as pretty as it could/should be, or as flexible, and I would like to circle back to implement DQN/DDQN into the more mature code structure of the later projects\n",
    "* **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)** (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952) was implemented, but never fully tested. I would like to optimize and adapt this more generally for future agents of all frameworks. Although this class did not require PER to achieve fast, excellent results on any projects, this would be a great tool to add into any Reinforcement Learning framework.\n",
    "* **Dueling DQN** would be good to explore further. While I became familiar with the concepts of an Advantage function (which is the key contribution of Dueling DQN to the overall algorithm) during study, I have yet to implement an agent with an Advantage function portion. This is key to many policy based algorithms and is a high priority for further study.\n",
    "* A so-called **\"Rainbow\"** implementation would utilize all of these tools to produce a superior agent.\n",
    "* **Visual/Pixel based training** was implemented but was not successful, in this project, at converging in any predictable way. Due to time constraints I moved on to other projects and more advanced/state-of-the-art algorithms, but training from visual data is extremely important to machine learning in general and I need to devote further time to a strong implementation of convolutional neural network based training."
